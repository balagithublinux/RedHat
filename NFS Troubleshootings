How to disable a specific version of NFS on my NFS server?    or 
How to configure an NFS server to only accept connections via specific versions of NFS?
=======================================================================================

To turn off NFSv4 support, edit 

# vi  /etc/sysconfig/nfs
     RPCNFSDARGS="-N 4"

# systemctl restart nfs

* Where -N X tells the rpc.nfsd daemon to not offer X version of NFS.


How to bypass or disable the NFS cache on a NFS client.
=======================================================

Resolution

    This is an expected behavior from the NFS client.

    There is no specific option available to be used with with nfs mount 
    which would ensure that data transfer would by-pass the page cache or kernel cache.

    Use the "sync" option while mounting the filesystem to ensure highest data integrety and to get better data transfer.
    
How to check connected NFS clients to NFS server ? 
===================================================
    Run this on NFS Server:

# netstat -an | grep 192.168.0.254:2049

NOTE: 192.168.0.254 is NFS Server and 2049 is NFS Server port no.


How to check supported NFS version ?
====================================

    # rpcinfo -p <NFS server IP>

    program    vers      proto   port
    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    3    udp   2049  nfs
    100003    4   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    2   tcp    2049  nfs
    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    4   tcp   2049  nfs



RHEL mount hangs: nfs: server [...] not responding, still trying
==================================================================

Troubleshooting with packet captures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of these steps is to isolate the problem into one of 3 categories:

    Problem between the NFS Client and NFS Server
    Problem on the NFS Server
    Problem on the NFS Client

Once the problem is isolated, further troubleshooting is required to fix the problem, and is beyond the scope of this solution.

The most direct means of troubleshooting this issue requires at least packet captures from both the NFS Client and NFS Server perspectives. 
In some scenarios, it may be possible to diagnose with a packet capture on just one side, such as the NFS Client, but both sides are highly recommended.

NOTE: Any tcpdump capture should only contain packets involving the problematic NFS server. 
If using tcpdump, you can accomplish this by using the 'host' pcap-filter and providing the NFS server name or IP address from the "not responding" message. 
Failing to filter the packet capture to only the problematic NFS server is very likely to result in delays in root cause analysis. Example:

# grep "not responding" /var/log/messages
Sep 29 22:54:39 client kernel: nfs: server server.example.com  not responding, still trying

# tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -w /tmp/tcpdump.pcap host server.example.com




NFS client shows "Input/output errors" while transferring huge data. 
=====================================================================

Root Cause

    The settings in /etc/fstab for timeo and retry being too small when combining with a heavy server load causes the calls to fail.

    * use the TCP defults of 60 seconds timeout, 2 retries (timeo=600,retry=2)
    
    
    
NFS Stale File Handle error and solution
===============================================

error:
$ ls
.: Stale File Handle

Occur when the current directory of a process, running on your client, is removed on the server while client in use.

# umount -f /mnt/local
# mount -t nfs nfsserver:/path/to/share /mnt/local



How to enable NFS v4.2 on RHEL7? 
================================

    Edit the /etc/sysconfig/nfs file to set the RPCNFSDARGS flag to "-V 4.2":

 #grep RPCNFSDARGS /etc/sysconfig/nfs 
 RPCNFSDARGS="-V 4.2"

 # systemctl restart nfs-config.service 
 # systemctl restart nfs-server.service
